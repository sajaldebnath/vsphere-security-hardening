This script checks for the security best practices that are implemented in vSphere environment. To get the report put both the script Get-Security.ps1 and SecurityFunctions.ps1 in the same folder and run the script Get-Security.ps1.

Once the script is run an output html file similar to "vcenter.lab.com_Security_Report_8-9-2015-0-28.html" will be generated. Download the sample file for checking the output.
